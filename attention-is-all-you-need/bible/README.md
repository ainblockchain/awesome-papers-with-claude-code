# Attention Is All You Need Learning Path

A Claude Code-powered interactive learning path based on
"Attention Is All You Need" by Vaswani et al., 2017.

## Getting Started

1. Open Claude Code in this directory:
   cd attention-is-all-you-need/bible/
   claude
2. Start learning — just chat naturally:
   explore              # see the knowledge graph
   teach me <concept>   # start a lesson
   give me a challenge  # get a quiz
   done                 # mark complete, move on

## Sharing Progress with Friends

1. Create your learner branch:
   git checkout -b learner/your-name
2. Commit progress as you learn:
   git add .learner/
   git commit -m "Progress update"
   git push origin learner/your-name
3. Fetch friends' branches:
   git fetch --all
   friends
