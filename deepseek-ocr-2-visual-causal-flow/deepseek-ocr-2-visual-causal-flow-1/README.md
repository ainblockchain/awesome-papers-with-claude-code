# DeepSeek-OCR 2: Visual Causal Flow Learning Path

A Claude Code-powered interactive learning path based on
"DeepSeek-OCR 2: Visual Causal Flow" by Haoran Wei, Yaofeng Sun, Yukun Li, 2026.

## Getting Started

1. Open Claude Code in this directory:
   ```bash
   cd deepseek-ocr-2-visual-causal-flow-1/
   claude
   ```
2. Start learning — just chat naturally:
   ```
   explore              # see the knowledge graph
   teach me <concept>   # start a lesson
   give me a challenge  # get a quiz
   done                 # mark complete, move on
   ```

## Sharing Progress with Friends

1. Create your learner branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b learner/your-name
   ```
2. Commit progress as you learn:
   ```bash
   git add .learner/
   git commit -m "Progress update"
   git push origin learner/your-name
   ```
3. Fetch friends' branches:
   ```bash
   git fetch --all
   friends
   ```
